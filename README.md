# Go Game project in university

This is a go game project made by 2 university students which is written entirely in C++ using SFML library for UI

## Simple instruction

Ensure that CMake is available in your machine. You can download CMake from the official website https://cmake.org/download/

After that open the terminal in the current location pointing to the root of the project, then run these command lines

Remember to connect the device to the internet since CMake will download SFML after you run the programs

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

After all the preparations are finished, from the root of the project go to the `build/bin/Debug/` gogame and run the `gogame.exe`

More detail instructions are inside the `INTRUCTIONS.md` file
